Many times i have seen there is no page title for many WebPages. Avoid doing that, add Page title to each pages, the Page title should be present under 'HEAD' section of page.
When user search any 'term' in Google then if the searched 'term' is exist in title then it will displayed as BOLD in Google search result. Most of the time the Google suggestion list is picked from Page title itself.

## How search engine works

When search engine find the pages in whole web ocean, Search engine works with the help of the page elements itself, it consider following things while searching.

- Proper Title of the page which helps people to know more about your article without opening it, we have seen if your title is proper and useful then search engine like Google show them in BOLD in top of the page
- Keywords that are used in page. The keywords are the words that are put by the user in search engine criteria for searching, so our website should contain proper and popular keywords. Frequency and location of keywords is most important in Web page.
do not try to include 'FAKE' keywords in your website that are not related to your web content otherwise your website may be BLACK listed by search engine. If the keyword only appears once within the body of a page, it will receive a low score for that keyword.
You should use your main keyword for each page in the file name, preferably at the beginning of the first sentence. 
- Links used in page are played important role in searching. Search engine uses 'crawing and indexing' like algorithms for link search, it follows the link and check for the rating of linked page.
Broken link, spam link may decrease your website ratings, Google like search engine looks at how many Web pages link to a particular site to determine its relevance
- Uniqueness of the content is also a noticed by search engine and proper use of Meta tags is also important.
- One of the noticeable aspect is "How long the Web page has existed on web?", The age of the page is also considered while searching. People create new Web pages every day, and not all of them stick around for long, Google link search engines places more value on pages with an established history.

Google like search engine take use of automated robots for searching like "crawlers" or "spiders", with the help of them it can reach to many billions of interconnected documents. Currently, the major engines typically interpret importance as popularity.
The more popular a site, page or document, the more your rating is. Here in this case search engines have continued to increase users’ satisfaction by using metrics that interpret popularity.

## Make our pages popular

- Don't be dishonest with your users or present them different content that are used for search optimization, this is commonly referred to as cloaking.
- While you make website you should make a clear hierarchy of text and links. Every page should be reachable from at least one static text link.
- Create a useful, information-rich site, and write pages that clearly and accurately describe your content. 
- Make sure that your "TITLE" elements and "ALT" attributes are descriptive and accurate.
- Give rel='nofollows' attributes to every link that you used in your websites, it will stop the search engines to follow the link, it will improve performance.
- First you need to understand the Use of keywords, it is the pathfinder for websites, You should create descriptive, human friendly URLs.
